# FUNKY VR PACHINKO
A FUNKY game about PACHINKO in VIRTUAL REALITY for KHE Fall 2017.

Decription as it appears on Devpost https://devpost.com/software/funky-vr-pachinko

## Inspiration

Inspired by[ Japanese Pachinko Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko). This difficult game will have you scratching your head! What's the best way to drop the ball into the machine to make the goal? The best part is that instead of gambling away your life savings on a real pachinko machine, you can get the same frustration* in your web browser!

*(Deafeningly loud [EUROBEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurobeat) music is not included.)

## What it does

Lets you play a simple game of [pachinko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko) in your Web Browser! If you're using Firefox 55 or Higher and have an [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/) or [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/us/) you can play in VR using WebVR!

Not made of money? You can use your favorite mobile web browser and a [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) viewer for a similar experience!

## How I built it

I built it with [A-Frame.io](https://aframe.io/)! I used the A-Frame inspector tool for general placement, and the Atom editor for cleaning things up and defining the initial geometry of things.

## Challenges I ran into

I didn't have my own computer for this hackathon! I had to use university computers for this, without a VR headset.

MLH ran out of laptop chargers, so I had to develop this whole thing with the Library reference computers, as well as without a VR Headset. It wasn't so bad though! The library Computers had Atom installed, which was nice.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Shipping something with limited resources!

## What I learned

Game Physics can be fickle.

## What's next for FUNKY VR Pachinko!

More Pachi! ~ Yeah!
